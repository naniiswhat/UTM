                                        <br><p> &emsp; Today morning, I learned how to assemble and reassemble a PC. This is a new experience for me
                                            even though I'm really scared that the PC might get damaged. But it was fun to play with it. Here are some steps to assemble a PC:
                                            <ul>
                                                <br><li>Open the case</li>
                                                <li>Disconnect all the connected wires.</li>
                                                <li>Remove the power supply</li>
                                                <li>Remove off the RAM</li>
                                                <li>Remove the Hard Disk</li>
                                                <li>Remove the CPU fan</li>
                                            </ul><br>
                                            To reassemble, just reverse the steps. Hopefully, it runs well.
                                            After the lab, we are going to take a quiz about what we learned before. It's easy if you remember the steps.
