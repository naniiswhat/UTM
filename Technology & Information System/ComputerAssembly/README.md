                                        <br><p> &emsp; This morning, I had just learned how to assemble and reassemble a PC. It's a pretty refreshing experience for me, But it was pretty interesting to tinker with it. For you to assemble a PC:
                                            <ul>
                                                <br><li>Open the casing</li>
                                                <li>Disconnect all the connected wires.</li>
                                                <li>Remove the power supply</li>
                                                <li>Remove off the RAM</li>
                                                <li>Remove the Hard Disk</li>
                                                <li>Remove the CPU fan</li>
                                            </ul><br>
                                            To reassemble, just reverse the steps.
                                            After the lab, we took a quiz about what we learned, highlighting about the order of assembling before.
