                                        <br><p> &emsp; Today, I'm working on a digital logic circuit to enhance my understanding through Deeds's software
                                          experiments rather than just theory. This lab requires me to partner with my roommate. Initially,
                                          it was challenging because we had to understand the question given to us. We decided to design the circuit on scratch first before design it in Deeds than we do several check just to confirm if our answers is right before submit in e-learning. <br><br>
                                          &emsp; Finally, it worked! We submit our work through submission link in e-learning.
